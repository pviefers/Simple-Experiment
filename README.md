# Simple-Experiment
This repository contains files that implement a simple laboratory experiment using Shiny from RStudio. 
It can be easily configured and handles the basic user login and stores user inputs in a csv file locally. Alternatively, user inputs can be saved remotely using dropbox or AWS S3.
