# Simple-Experiment
This repository contains files that implement a simple laboratory experiment using Shiny from RStudio. 
It can be easily configured and handles the basic user login and stores user inputs in a csv file locally. Alternatively, user inputs can be saved remotely using dropbox or AWS S3.

How to run the app
===
Download the files and put them in a folder together with anothert folder called 'responses'. In the response folder the user inputs will be saved as CSV-files. 

Next open the ui.R or server.R in RStudio and click on 'Run App'.
